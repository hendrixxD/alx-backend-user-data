#  An important note about using Response.
# iter_content versus Response.raw.
# Response.iter_content will automatically
# decode the gzip and deflate transfer-encodings.
# Response.raw is a raw stream of bytes â€“
# it does not transform the response content. 
# If you really need access to the bytes as
# they were returned, use Response.raw.
